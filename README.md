# Interactive Frontend Development Project: Mimic – The Memory Game
The Interactive Front-End Development (IFD) Milestone project was to build a front-end only, single-player memory game inspired from the Simon game. 

Mimic the Memory game consists of 30 levels. The aim of this game is to replay (mimic) the system’s sequence.
